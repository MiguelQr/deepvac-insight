"""PyInstaller build spec for DeepVac Insight.

Build (onedir -- torch is large enough that --onefile's per-launch
re-extraction into a temp dir would make every startup slow; onedir starts
instantly after the first run):

    pyinstaller deepvac.spec

Output: dist/DeepVac/DeepVac.exe, plus its bundled resources/ and
app/model/model.pt sitting alongside it, plus every Python/Qt/torch
dependency. Feed that dist/DeepVac/ folder to installer/deepvac.iss (Inno
Setup) to produce a real Windows installer with Start Menu shortcuts and an
uninstaller -- see installer/README.md.

User-writable data (databases, logs, backups, generated reports) is never
bundled here: app/common.py resolves it to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\DeepVac\\data at
runtime when frozen (sys.frozen), independent of wherever this bundle
itself ends up installed (e.g. Program Files, which a normal user account
can't write to).
